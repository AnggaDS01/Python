I took Opanas since October 2011, then out of the blue, my DR. says there is no more Opanas for now and put me on NUCYNTA. I got absolutely no pain relief from it. Along with suddenly putting me on a new medication, it interacted with the anxiety meds I am on. Nucynta should be sold over the counter, due to it\\s equilavent to Tylenol. It\\'s caused people to commit suicide and homocide. It\\'s a shame doctors think everyone abuses narcotic pain meds which leaves the few of us that don\\'t in a mess.

I keep one container of the Prevident in my bathroom on in my dad\\'s and one in my suitcase for when I got out of town to make sure I don\\'t forget. So now I\\'m paranoid. He gave me these samples of I guess it\\'s a new Biotene product that is some kind of dry mouth gel and told me to rub it on my tongue some during the day and swish it around. I couldn\\'t find any at the drugstore so I ordered it of Amazon and then at Walgreens I got a dry mouth spray bottle. \\nI also have started using the Prevident each time I brush hoping that may help. He had told me I could do that but please note I am not a doctor and I happened to be a particularly bad situation So please don\\'t go by what I\\'m doing; ask your dentist if you have any questions or are thinking of using PreviDent at all your brushings\n",

      "My niece was put on Strattera twice, now. The first time at age 10 - 11, she complained that the medicine was making her vomit and she felt terrible for the rest of the day. There was no difference noticed by either the teachers or her family. The second time at age 12, we had to deal with a child that would scream, throw things and become violent. We were pulling our hair out dealing with her and most of the time someone would get hurt, usually the adults trying to restrain her. I have had bruises on my arms and my legs because of her extreme mood swings,it was like a light switch. She then started to tell us she hated herself and wanted to die. She went so far as to threaten other members of the family. This is a child that is loving, caring not what we have dealt with for 3 months now. We even spent 8 hours in the ER because of suicidal thoughts. We began to notice that the days that she refused to take it, we didn\\t have such an angry child. We decided that she will no longer take Strattera. The doctor will have to find something else. As for her grades she is now failing before she was making As and Bs\n",

      "DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE!!! I actually wrote another review a few weeks ago and talked about how GREAT it worked for me! Sadly that is not the case anymore. My life has been nothing, but hell the last month. I took the Clydimycin to clear up a severe tooth infection, bc I\\m allerigic to Amoxicillin. To make a long story short the Clydimiycin cleared up my infection after 4 days. I finished the medication and began to have a reaction a few days later! And by reaction....I mean THRUSH on my tonsils and a rash on my upper torso! So I went to my family doctor and he gave me Bactrim to clear up the reaction. I woke up today covered in hives from head to toe!!!! I went to the ER and had to get a steroid injection in my A!!! My doctor said its all a reaction from the Clydamycin and I\\'ll never take it again\n",

The only side effects that I experinced were felt a lttle sick to my stomach for and about 30 minute after talking the pill, a little restless sleep but not every night and it dulled my tatse.  But that\\s nothing compare to getting the tobacco monkey off my back.........I highly recommend this\n"
